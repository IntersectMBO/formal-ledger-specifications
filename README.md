# Formal ledger specifications

This repository contains the formal ledger specifications that are intended to eventually replace the existing formal specifications of the Cardano ledger found [here](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger). This project is currently incomplete and work in progress.

This repository currently contains two specifications---the work in progress specification for Cardano (up to and including the Conway era) and a small example that was produced for the Midnight project (but is unrelated to any actual Midnight code/features). Each specification is executable and contains some documentation in the form of a PDF document. They can be built by following the steps below.

--------------------

## Building and Testing the Formal Specification

Clone this repository and enter its directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/input-output-hk/formal-ledger-specifications.git
cd formal-ledger-specifications
```


### Building the spec using nix-build

Invoke the following `nix-build` commands from inside the `formal-ledger-specifications` directory.

```
nix-build -A ledger.executableSpec     # build the spec
nix-build -A ledger.docs               # build the spec docs
nix-build -A midnight.executableSpec   # build the Midnight example
nix-build -A midnight.docs             # build the Midnight example docs
```

### Test the spec using nix-shell


The `executableSpec` is a `cabal` package, which can be loaded into GHCI like this:

```
nix-shell --command "cabal repl --build-depends 'agda-ledger-executable-spec, agda-ledger-executable-spec-midnight'"
Î»> :m HSLedgerTest
Î»> main
```
