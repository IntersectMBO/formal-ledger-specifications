# Formal Ledger Specifications

This repository contains the formal ledger specifications for the Cardano blockchain,
written in [Agda](https://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php). These
specifications are executable, and the project is a work-in-progress which will
eventually replace the existing TeX-based formal specifications.

The repository provides the specification for the Cardano ledger up to and including
the Conway era. You can interact with the specification by building the artifacts,
generating Haskell source code for conformance testing, or exploring the Agda source
in a development environment.

## **Published Artifacts**

The official PDF specifications and a browseable HTML version of the source code are generated by our CI pipeline and published.

| Artifact | Link | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Full PDF Specification** | [cardano-ledger.pdf](https://IntersectMBO.github.io/formal-ledger-specifications/cardano-ledger.pdf) | The complete specification for the Cardano Ledger. |
| **Conway-Era PDF** | [conway-ledger.pdf](https://IntersectMBO.github.io/formal-ledger-specifications/conway-ledger.pdf) | A differential specification for the Conway era. |
| **HTML Source Code** | [Browseable HTML](https://IntersectMBO.github.io/formal-ledger-specifications/html/index.html) | An interactive, hyperlinked version of the Agda source code. |

**Note on PDFs:** As we are migrating from a LaTeX-based to a Markdown-based documentation workflow, **building** PDFs **from source is currently deprecated and unsupported.** Please use the links above to access the official, pre-built PDF documents.

## **🚀 Quick Start: Building Local Artifacts**

### **Clone the Repository**

```
git clone https://github.com/IntersectMBO/formal-ledger-specifications.git
cd formal-ledger-specifications
```

### **Build Targets**

Invoke the following `nix-build` commands from inside the
`formal-ledger-specifications` directory
(You must have [Nix](https://nixos.org/download/) installed and have enabled [Nix Flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes).)

```
# Type-check the entire Agda specification (the default package)
nix build .#formal-ledger
# Or, more simply:
nix build

# Generate Haskell source code from the Agda specification
nix build .#hs-src

# Generate a local browseable HTML version of the Agda source code
nix build .#html

# Build the mkdocs documentation site
nix build .#mkdocs
```

The build results will be available in the `result/` directory.

### Conformance-testing example

For an example on how to use the Agda-generated Haskell code for conformance
testing see [`conformance-example`](conformance-example)
