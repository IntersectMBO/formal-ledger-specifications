# Formal ledger specifications

This repository contains the formal ledger specifications that are intended to eventually replace the existing formal specifications of the Cardano ledger found [here](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger). This project is currently incomplete and work in progress.

## Building the specifications

This repository currently contains two specifications the work in progress specification for Cardano (up to and including the Conway era) and a small example that was produced for the Midnight project (but is unrelated to any actual Midnight code/features). Each specification is executable and contains some documentation in the form of a PDF document. They can be built as follows:

```
nix-build -A ledger.executableSpec
nix-build -A ledger.docs
nix-build -A midnight.executableSpec
nix-build -A midnight.docs
```

The `executableSpec` is a `cabal` package, which can be loaded into GHCI like this:

```
nix-shell --command "cabal repl --build-depends 'agda-ledger-executable-spec, agda-ledger-executable-spec-midnight'"
Î»> :m HSLedgerTest
Î»> main
```
