# `applyToRewards` Preservation of Value {#sec:apply-to-rewards-pov}

This module proves preservation of value for the two specialisations of
`applyToRewards`{.AgdaFunction} used inside the `ENTITIES`{.AgdaDatatype} rule:

+  `applyWithdrawals-pov`{.AgdaFunction}: `applyWithdrawals`{.AgdaFunction}
   *decreases* the total rewards balance by exactly the sum of withdrawal
   amounts.  Truncating subtraction (`_∸_`) means the per-step lemma requires
   `amt ≤ bal`, and the fold induction requires a `Unique`{.AgdaDatatype} witness on
   the stake-projected withdrawal list so that no already-reduced balance is
   revisited.
+  `applyDirectDeposits-pov`{.AgdaFunction}: `applyDirectDeposits`{.AgdaFunction}
   *increases* the total rewards balance by exactly the sum of direct-deposit
   amounts.  Because `_+_` is total and commutative, revisiting a credential is
   harmless, so neither the `NetworkId`{.AgdaFunction} witness nor the
   `Unique`{.AgdaDatatype} premise is needed.

Both lemmas share a common backbone: a per-step result about
`applyOne`{.AgdaFunction} (the lambda body of `applyToRewards`{.AgdaFunction})
together with a `foldl`-induction lemma over `setToList (m ˢ)`.  They are consumed
directly by `ENTITIES-pov`{.AgdaFunction} in `Entities.Properties.PoV`.

## The `ApplyToRewards-PoV` module

The three assumed identities below are the same set/map identities used
by the Conway PoV proofs; they are stated as module parameters here to
keep this commit focused on the fold-induction structure and to be
discharged in a follow-up against the `agda-sets` library.

+  `∪ˡ-lookup-preserve`: lookup in a left-biased union with a singleton
   at `c` agrees with lookup in the right map for any key `c' ≠ c`.
+  `sum-map-proj₂≡getCoin`: the `getCoin`{.AgdaFunction} representation
   of a `(RewardAddress ⇀ Coin)` map equals the list-sum of its second
   projections.
+  `setToList-Unique`: stake-projection of a withdrawal/direct-deposit
   list is `Unique`{.AgdaDatatype}, assuming the per-batch
   `NetworkId`{.AgdaFunction} constraint.  Used only by
   `applyWithdrawals-pov`.

```agda
module ApplyToRewards-PoV
  ( ∪ˡ-lookup-preserve :
      (m : Rewards) (c : Credential) (v : Coin) (c' : Credential)
      → c' ≢ c → lookupᵐ? (❴ c , v ❵ ∪ˡ m) c' ≡ lookupᵐ? m c' )

  ( sum-map-proj₂≡getCoin :
      (m : RewardAddress ⇀ Coin)
      → sum (map proj₂ (setToList (m ˢ))) ≡ getCoin m )

  ( setToList-Unique :
      (m : RewardAddress ⇀ Coin)
      → ∀[ a ∈ dom (m ˢ) ] NetworkIdOf a ≡ NetworkId
      → Unique (map (stake ∘ proj₁) (setToList (m ˢ))) )
  where
```

A local convenience definitionally equal to the lambda body of `applyToRewards f`:

```agda
  applyOne : (Coin → Coin → Coin) → Rewards → RewardAddress × Coin → Rewards
  applyOne f acc (addr , amt) =
    maybe (λ bal → ❴ stake addr , f bal amt ❵ ∪ˡ acc) acc (lookupᵐ? acc (stake addr))
```

## Withdrawal preservation of value

### `applyOne-pov` (one withdrawal step decreases `getCoin` by `amt`)

When `lookupᵐ? acc (stake addr) ≡ just bal` and `amt ≤ bal`, applying a
single withdrawal reduces the total by exactly `amt`.

```agda
  applyOne-pov : (acc : Rewards) (addr : RewardAddress) (amt bal : Coin)
    → lookupᵐ? acc (stake addr) ≡ just bal
    → amt ≤ bal
    → getCoin acc ≡ getCoin (❴ stake addr , bal ∸ amt ❵ ∪ˡ acc) + amt
```

<!--
```agda
  applyOne-pov acc addr amt bal lookup-eq amt≤bal = let c = stake addr in
    begin
      getCoin acc
        ≡⟨ split-by-lookup acc c bal lookup-eq ⟩
      getCoin (acc ∣ ❴ c ❵ ᶜ) + bal
        ≡⟨ cong (getCoin (acc ∣ ❴ c ❵ ᶜ) +_) (sym (m∸n+n≡m amt≤bal)) ⟩
      getCoin (acc ∣ ❴ c ❵ ᶜ) + (bal ∸ amt + amt)
        ≡⟨ trans (sym (+-assoc (getCoin (acc ∣ ❴ c ❵ ᶜ)) (bal ∸ amt) amt))
                 (cong (_+ amt) (+-comm (getCoin (acc ∣ ❴ c ❵ ᶜ)) (bal ∸ amt))) ⟩
      (bal ∸ amt) + getCoin (acc ∣ ❴ c ❵ ᶜ) + amt
        ≡˘⟨ cong (_+ amt) (getCoin-∪ˡ-overwrite acc c (bal ∸ amt)) ⟩
      getCoin (❴ c , bal ∸ amt ❵ ∪ˡ acc) + amt
        ∎
```

### `foldl-applyOne-pov` (fold induction)

The fold invariant tracks three things through the induction: every remaining
withdrawal credential is in the current accumulator's domain; every remaining
withdrawal amount is bounded by the current balance at that credential; and no
credential is revisited (the `Unique`{.AgdaDatatype} witness on the stake-projected
list).  Uniqueness is essential here precisely because `applyOne _∸_` *modifies*
the balance at the targeted credential — without it, a re-visit could attempt to
subtract from an already-reduced balance for which the caller's original `amt ≤ bal`
bound no longer holds.

```agda
  foldl-applyOne-pov : (acc : Rewards) (entries : List (RewardAddress × Coin))
    → ( ∀ {addr amt} → (addr , amt) ∈ˡ entries
        → stake addr ∈ dom acc
        × amt ≤ maybe id 0 (lookupᵐ? acc (stake addr)) )
    → Unique (map (stake ∘ proj₁) entries)
    → getCoin acc
      ≡ getCoin (foldl (applyOne _∸_) acc entries) + sum (map proj₂ entries)
```

## Direct-deposit preservation of value

### `applyOne-pov-add` (one direct-deposit step increases `getCoin` by `amt`)

For addition, no `amt ≤ bal` premise is needed (the operation is total),
and the per-step equation is `getCoin (...) ≡ getCoin acc + amt`
unconditionally on the relationship between `amt` and the current
balance.

```agda
  applyOne-pov-add :
    (acc : Rewards) (addr : RewardAddress) (amt bal : Coin)
    → lookupᵐ? acc (stake addr) ≡ just bal
    → getCoin (❴ stake addr , bal + amt ❵ ∪ˡ acc) ≡ getCoin acc + amt
```

<!--
```agda

        ≡⟨ getCoin-∪ˡ-overwrite acc c (bal + amt) ⟩
      (bal + amt) + getCoin (acc ∣ ❴ c ❵ ᶜ)
        ≡⟨ +-comm (bal + amt) (getCoin (acc ∣ ❴ c ❵ ᶜ)) ⟩

        ≡˘⟨ cong (_+ amt) (split-by-lookup acc c bal lookup-eq) ⟩
      getCoin acc + amt
        ∎
```
-->

### `foldl-applyOne-pov-add` (fold induction, no `Unique` needed)

Unlike the withdrawal version, the additive fold induction needs only
domain preservation — the `Unique`{.AgdaDatatype} witness drops out.
The reason: `applyOne _+_` modifies the balance at the targeted
credential, but since the per-step lemma `applyOne-pov-add` is
unconditional on the prior balance and `_+_` is commutative, revisiting
the same credential simply accumulates additions correctly.

```agda
  foldl-applyOne-pov-add :
    (acc : Rewards) (entries : List (RewardAddress × Coin))
    → (∀ {addr amt} → (addr , amt) ∈ˡ entries → stake addr ∈ dom acc)
    → getCoin (foldl (applyOne _+_) acc entries)
      ≡ getCoin acc + sum (map proj₂ entries)
```

<!--
```agda

  foldl-applyOne-pov-add acc ((addr , amt) ∷ xs) h
    with lookupᵐ? acc (stake addr) in eq
  ... | just bal = begin
        getCoin (foldl (applyOne _+_) acc' xs)
          ≡⟨ foldl-applyOne-pov-add acc' xs h' ⟩

          ≡⟨ +-assoc (getCoin acc) amt (sum (map proj₂ xs)) ⟩

    c = stake addr
    acc' = ❴ c , bal + amt ❵ ∪ˡ acc

    h' : ∀ {addr' amt'} → (addr' , amt') ∈ˡ xs → stake addr' ∈ dom acc'
    h' mem = dom∪ˡʳ {m = ❴ c , bal + amt ❵} {m' = acc} (h (there mem))

### `applyDirectDeposits-pov`

Note the slimmed-down signature relative to `applyWithdrawals-pov`: no
`NetworkId`{.AgdaFunction} premise (none is needed), no
`amt ≤ balance` premise (addition doesn't truncate).

```agda
  applyDirectDeposits-pov : (dd : DirectDeposits) (rwds : Rewards)
    → mapˢ stake (dom dd) ⊆ dom rwds
    → getCoin (applyDirectDeposits dd rwds) ≡ getCoin rwds + getCoin dd
