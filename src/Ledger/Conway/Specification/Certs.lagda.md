## Changes Introduced in the Conway Era

### Delegation

Registered credentials can now delegate to a DRep as well as to a stake
pool. This is achieved by giving the
`delegate`{.AgdaInductiveConstructor} certificate two optional fields,
corresponding to a DRep and stake pool.

Stake can be delegated for voting and block production simultaneously,
since these are two separate features. In fact, preventing this could
weaken the security of the chain, since security relies on high
participation of honest stake holders.

### Removal of Pointer Addresses, Genesis Delegations and MIR Certificates

Support for pointer addresses, genesis delegations and MIR certificates
is removed (see [CIP-1694](https://cips.cardano.org/cip-1694) and
[CKB+23](#cip1694)). In `DState`{.AgdaDatatype}, this means that the
four fields relating to those features are no longer present, and
`DelegEnv`{.AgdaDatatype} contains none of the fields it used to in the
Shelley era (see [CVG19, ](#shelley-ledger-spec)).

Note that pointer addresses are still usable, only their staking
functionality has been retired. So all funds locked behind pointer
addresses are still accessible, they just don’t count towards the stake
distribution anymore. Genesis delegations and MIR certificates have been
superceded by the new governance mechanisms, in particular the
`TreasuryWithdrawal`{.AgdaInductiveConstructor} governance action in
case of the MIR certificates.

### Explicit Deposits

Registration and deregistration of staking credentials are now required
to explicitly state the deposit that is being paid or refunded. This
deposit is used for checking correctness of transactions with
certificates. Including the deposit aligns better with other design
decisions such as having explicit transaction fees and helps make this
information visible to light clients and hardware wallets.

While not shown in the figures, the old certificates without explicit
deposits will still be supported for some time for backwards
compatibility.

## Governance Certificate Rules

The rules for transition systems dealing with individual certificates
are defined in
Sections [Auxiliary `DELEG`{.AgdaDatatype} Transition System](#auxiliary-deleg-transition-system),
[Auxiliary `POOL`{.AgdaDatatype} transition system](#auxiliary-pool-transition-system), and
[Auxiliary `GOVCERT`{.AgdaDatatype} transition system](#auxiliary-govcert-transition-system).

`GOVCERT`{.AgdaDatatype} deals with the new certificates relating to
DReps and the constitutional committee.

+  `GOVCERT-regdrep`{.AgdaInductiveConstructor} registers (or
   re-registers) a DRep. In case of registration, a deposit needs to be
   paid. Either way, the activity period of the DRep is reset.

+  `GOVCERT-deregdrep`{.AgdaInductiveConstructor} deregisters a DRep.

+  `GOVCERT-ccreghot`{.AgdaInductiveConstructor} registers a "hot"
   credential for constitutional committee members.[^1] We check that the
   cold key did not previously resign from the committee. We allow this
   delegation for any cold credential that is either part of
   `EnactState`{.AgdaRecord} or a proposal. This allows a newly
   elected member of the constitutional committee to immediately delegate
   their vote to a hot key and use it to vote. Since votes are counted
   after previous actions have been enacted, this allows constitutional
   committee members to act without a delay of one epoch.


### Auxiliary DELEG transition system

```agda

  DELEG-delegate :
    ∙ (c ∉ dom rwds → d ≡ pp .keyDeposit)

    ∙ mvd ∈ mapˢ (just ∘ vDelegCredential) delegatees ∪
            fromList ( nothing ∷ just vDelegAbstain ∷ just vDelegNoConfidence ∷ [] )
    ∙ mkh ∈ mapˢ just (dom pools) ∪ ❴ nothing ❵

```


### Auxiliary POOL transition system

```agda
data _⊢_⇀⦇_,POOL⦈_ : PoolEnv → PState → DCert → PState → Type where

  POOL-regpool :
    ∙ kh ∉ dom pools
      ────────────────────────────────

  POOL-retirepool :
    ────────────────────────────────
    pp ⊢ ⟦ pools , retiring ⟧ ⇀⦇ retirepool kh e ,POOL⦈ ⟦ pools , ❴ kh , e ❵ ∪ˡ retiring ⟧
```


### Auxiliary GOVCERT transition system

```agda
data _⊢_⇀⦇_,GOVCERT⦈_ : CertEnv → GState → DCert → GState → Type where

  GOVCERT-regdrep :
    ∙ (d ≡ pp .drepDeposit × c ∉ dom dReps) ⊎ (d ≡ 0 × c ∈ dom dReps)
      ────────────────────────────────
      ⟦ e , pp , vs , wdrls , cc ⟧ ⊢ ⟦ dReps , ccKeys ⟧ ⇀⦇ regdrep c d an ,GOVCERT⦈ ⟦ ❴ c , e + pp .drepActivity ❵ ∪ˡ dReps , ccKeys ⟧

  GOVCERT-deregdrep :

      ────────────────────────────────
      ⟦ e , pp , vs , wdrls , cc ⟧ ⊢ ⟦ dReps , ccKeys ⟧ ⇀⦇ deregdrep c d ,GOVCERT⦈ ⟦ dReps ∣ ❴ c ❵ ᶜ , ccKeys ⟧

  GOVCERT-ccreghot :
    ∙ (c , nothing) ∉ ccKeys
    ∙ c ∈ cc
      ────────────────────────────────
      ⟦ e , pp , vs , wdrls , cc ⟧ ⊢ ⟦ dReps , ccKeys ⟧ ⇀⦇ ccreghot c mc ,GOVCERT⦈ ⟦ dReps , ❴ c , mc ❵ ∪ˡ ccKeys ⟧
```

## The <span class="AgdaDatatype">CERTS</span> Transition System

This section culminates in the definition of the `CERTS`{.AgdaDatatype} transition
system by bundling previously defined pieces together into a
`CERT`{.AgdaDatatype} transition rule which `CERTS`{.AgdaDatatype} runs on a sequence
of signals, keeping track of the certification state as it progresses.

### The <span class="AgdaDatatype">CERT</span> Transition System

```agda
data _⊢_⇀⦇_,CERT⦈_  : CertEnv → CertState → DCert → CertState → Type where

  CERT-deleg :
    ∙ ⟦ pp , PState.pools stᵖ , dom (GState.dreps stᵍ) ⟧ ⊢ stᵈ ⇀⦇ dCert ,DELEG⦈ stᵈ'
      ────────────────────────────────
      ⟦ e , pp , vs , wdrls , cc ⟧ ⊢ ⟦ stᵈ , stᵖ , stᵍ ⟧ ⇀⦇ dCert ,CERT⦈ ⟦ stᵈ' , stᵖ , stᵍ ⟧

  CERT-pool :
    ∙ pp ⊢ stᵖ ⇀⦇ dCert ,POOL⦈ stᵖ'
      ────────────────────────────────
      ⟦ e , pp , vs , wdrls , cc ⟧ ⊢ ⟦ stᵈ , stᵖ , stᵍ ⟧ ⇀⦇ dCert ,CERT⦈ ⟦ stᵈ , stᵖ' , stᵍ ⟧

  CERT-vdel :

      ────────────────────────────────
      Γ ⊢ ⟦ stᵈ , stᵖ , stᵍ ⟧ ⇀⦇ dCert ,CERT⦈ ⟦ stᵈ , stᵖ , stᵍ' ⟧
```

### The <span class="AgdaFunction">CERTBASE</span> Function

Here we define the `CERTBASE`{.AgdaFunction} function which handles the following
important housekeeping tasks:

- check the correctness of withdrawals and ensure that withdrawals only
  happen from credentials that have delegated their voting power;

- set the rewards of the credentials that withdrew funds to zero;

- and set the activity timer of all DReps that voted to `drepActivity`{.AgdaField}
  epochs in the future.

[^1]: By "hot" and "cold" credentials we mean the following: a cold
    credential is used to register a hot credential, and then the hot
    credential is used for voting. The idea is that the access to the
    cold credential is kept in a secure location, while the hot
    credential is more conveniently accessed. If the hot credential is
    compromised, it can be changed using the cold credential.
