# Tiered fees and block diversity

This module and the changes it depends on are additions on top of the upstream
`master` formal-ledger-specifications. They introduce a two-tier, block-type-aware
fee/diversity scheme (fast tier = 0, slow tier = 1; Endorser Blocks vs Ranking
Blocks). The changes made relative to the `master` starting point are, per file:

- **Transaction** (`Transaction.lagda.md`) — new tier primitives: `TierNo`,
  `fastTier`/`slowTier`, `TierCoeff`, `WaitTime`, `BlockType` (`EB`/`RB`) and the
  `TxTier` record (`tierNo`, `tierCoeff`). `TxBody` gains `tier : TxTier` and
  `feeChangeAddr : Maybe RewardAddress`; `Tx` gains `actualTier : TierNo` (the tier
  the tx is actually placed in, ≤ `body.tier.tierNo`).

- **Abstract** (`Abstract.lagda.md`) — `AbstractFunctions` (now `Type₁`) gains the
  abstract EB machinery: the `Endorsement` type, and the checks
  `checkEndorsements : KeyHash → List Endorsement → Bool` and
  `checkEBID : KeyHash → KeyHash → Bool` (whether an id resolves to a block with a
  given body hash). EB ids are `KeyHash`es.

- **Tiers** (`Tiers.lagda.md`, this module — entirely new) — the diversity policy:
  `PolicyClause` (per-tier `coeffRange`), `DiversityPolicy = TierNo ⇀ PolicyClause`,
  `SDPolicy` (the policy plus per-block, per-tier accumulators `totalSize`,
  `totalRefScriptSize` and `totalExUnits`), the block-level `sdChecks` (RB must fit
  within `maxBlockSize`/`maxRefScriptSizePerBlock`/`maxBlockExUnits`; an EB must be ≥
  half of a full RB in every dimension — tx-body size, reference-script size, and
  ExUnits — summed across tiers), `updateTiers` (stub), and the `DIVUP` transition that
  recomputes the policy and resets the per-block accumulators.
  The EB half-RB check is the ledger-side counterpart of the mempool's `underHalfRB`
  EB-suppression rule (`MempoolLeiosPricing.lagda.md` in `ouroboros-consensus`), and is
  kept consistent with it on both previously-open points: (1) reference-script bytes are
  their own dimension here (`totalRefScriptSize`, checked against
  `maxRefScriptSizePerBlock`), matching the mempool's ref-script `Capacity` dimension;
  (2) the threshold is the fullness floor **`ebFloor` = ½ a full RB** per dimension (a
  design choice, not a CIP-164 requirement; SHOULD PROBABLY BE A PROTOCOL PARAMETER) —
  the EB check is `total ≥ ebFloor`, encoded as `2·total ≥ (full-RB limit)` until
  `ebFloor` is a parameter, so there is no rounding question once it is. The EB check is
  a **disjunction**: an EB is rejected only when below `ebFloor` in *every* dimension
  (valid as soon as ≥ `ebFloor` in one), the exact complement of the mempool's
  `underHalfRB`, which measures the same EB body against the same `ebFloor` — so an EB is
  suppressed there iff rejected here (measurement gap closed). NOTE the "small in every
  dimension" quantifier is probably up for discussion. `ebFloor` (the fullness *floor*,
  lower bound) is distinct from the CIP-164 per-EB *capacity* (`slowCap`/`S_EB`, upper
  bound), which the ledger does **not** yet enforce — TODO.

- **UTxO** (`Utxo.lagda.md`) — `UTxOEnv` gains `blockType`; `UTxOState` gains
  `policyState : SDPolicy` and `feeRewards : Credential ⇀ Coin` (pending fee-change
  credits). The fee of a valid (`Scripts-Yes`) tx is **checked on the claimed tier** but
  **charged/refunded on the actual tier**:
    * the admission gate (`tierFeeCheck`) uses the *claimed* coefficient
      `tier.tierCoeff` — `tier.tierCoeff · minfee ≤ txFee`;
    * the fee pot always keeps exactly `minfee`;
    * with `actualCoeff = coeffRange(dp[actualTier])` (the tier the tx actually landed
      in — EB ⇒ slow, RB ⇒ fast): *with* a `feeChangeAddr`, the treasury gets the
      actual-tier premium `(actualCoeff − 1)·minfee` and `txFee − actualCoeff·minfee` is
      refunded to the address; *without* one, the whole `txFee − minfee` goes to the
      treasury (no actual-tier discount — the excess is forfeited).
  So a fast-claimed tx bumped into an EB is charged the *slow* fee only if it names a
  change address. The split always sums to `txFee`, so `produced` need only account the
  full `txFee` and no longer depends on `BlockType`. In the `Scripts-No` case (script
  validation fails) the collateral is collected **in full** into the fee pot
  (`fees + cbalance (utxo ∣ collateralInputs)`) and no tier split / refund is made —
  `feeRewards` is carried through unchanged. New helpers `processTxTiers` (accumulate
  per-tier stats), `checkPolicyState` (tx coefficient matches the policy) and
  `tierFeeCheck` (`tier.tierCoeff·minfee ≤ txFee` in both block types, plus: RB requires
  every tx to be fast tier — `tier.tierNo ≡ fastTier` and `actualTier ≡ fastTier`; EB
  places txs of any tier). The `UTXOS`/`UTXO` rules thread `policyState`/`feeRewards`
  and add the tier premises.

  Note: **users always pay at least `minfee` to the pot; the check is on the claimed
  tier but the actual fee (and any refund) is on the tier the tx lands in — and only a
  stated `feeChangeAddr` lets the excess above the actual-tier fee come back rather than
  be donated to the treasury.**

  (Resolved) *Refund asymmetry.* Nothing above `minfee` is forfeited to the fee
  pot / block producer — the excess is either refunded (change address) or donated to
  the treasury.

  Placement premises: a tx may land in its claimed tier or a *slower* one (a fast tx can
  be bumped into an EB, where it is charged the cheaper slow fee and so gets more
  refunded), never a faster one. Encoded in `UTXO-inductive` as
  `tier.tierNo ≤ actualTier` and `coeffR ≤ tier.tierCoeff` (with `fast = 0 < slow = 1`,
  `fastCoeff ≥ slowCoeff`). This also keeps the actual-tier refund `txFee − actualCoeff·minfee`
  non-negative, since `actualCoeff ≤ tier.tierCoeff` and the gate gives
  `tier.tierCoeff·minfee ≤ txFee`.

- **Ledger** (`Ledger.lagda.md`) — `LEnv` gains `blockType`, threaded into the
  `UTXOW` environment; after each tx the accumulated `feeRewards` are flushed into
  the delegation state's reward accounts and then cleared.

- **BlockBody** (`BlockBody.lagda.md`) — defines `EBID = KeyHash` and the `EBCert`
  record (`ebid`, `endorsements`). `BHBody` gains `blockType`. `Block` gains
  `ebCert : Maybe EBCert`, so a Ranking Block carries *either* a transaction list
  (`ebCert ≡ nothing`) *or* an EB certificate (`ebCert ≡ just c`). `BBODY` now has two
  rules: the tx-list rule runs `LEDGERS` + the `DIVUP` transition over the block's
  `policyState`; the EB-cert rule checks endorsements (`checkEndorsements`), confirms
  the id (`checkEBID`), and runs `BBODY` recursively on the resolved Endorser Block.

- **Epoch** (`Epoch.lagda.md`) — `applyRUpd` and the POOLREAP update are adjusted
  for the widened 6-field `UTxOState` (carry `policyState`, reset `feeRewards`).

> **TODO** (pre-existing on this branch): the `UTXO-inductive⋯` convenience pattern
> in `Utxo.lagda.md` lists two fewer premise names than the rule now has.
