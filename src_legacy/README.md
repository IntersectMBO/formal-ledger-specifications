## src_legacy

This directory is where we will place copies of legacy versions of Agda source code
(`.lagda` files) before they are changed to `.lagda.md` files in the main `src`
directory.  It's useful to keep them around for now for comparison while we manually
edit and improve the markdown versions generated by the migration pipeline.
